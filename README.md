/**
 * AUTOMATED TIMESTAMP INJECTION SCRIPT FOR REACT DEPLOYMENT
 * 
 * This script solves a fundamental limitation of React applications deployed to GitHub Pages:
 * Unlike plain HTML sites where document.lastModified reflects when files were actually edited,
 * React apps go through a build process that creates fresh HTML files, making document.lastModified
 * show the build time rather than the deployment time.
 * 
 * PROBLEM SOLVED:
 * - React build process breaks file modification timestamp tracking
 * - GitHub Pages serves pre-built files, losing deployment context
 * - Need to show actual deployment time, not build time
 * 
 * SOLUTION:
 * - Inject current timestamp into lastmodified.html after build
 * - Replicate the exact behavior of plain HTML project sites
 * - Maintain consistency across portfolio projects
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Automatically executed by npm predeploy script
 * - Runs after build but before deployment to GitHub Pages
 * - No manual intervention required
 * 
 * INTEGRATION:
 * - Called by package.json predeploy script: "npm run build && node update-timestamp.js"
 * - Works with existing jQuery-based timestamp loading system

/**
 * DYNAMIC HTML CONTENT GENERATION
 * 
 * Creates JavaScript code that replicates the exact behavior of plain HTML sites
 * This approach maintains consistency with other portfolio projects that use
 * document.lastModified for timestamp display
 * 
 * TECHNICAL APPROACH:
 * - Creates a Date object from the deployment timestamp string
 * - Uses the same variable names and structure as plain HTML sites
 * - Applies .italics() formatting to match existing site styling
 * - Directly manipulates DOM element with id="lastmodified"
 * 
 * WHY THIS WORKS:
 * - Bypasses React build process limitations
 * - Provides actual deployment time instead of build time
 * - Maintains visual and functional consistency across portfolio

 * FILE WRITE OPERATION
 * 
 * Overwrites the built lastmodified.html file with deployment-time timestamp

 * 1. React build creates static files in /build directory
 * 2. This script executes and updates timestamp file
 * 3. gh-pages deploys the updated files to GitHub Pages
 * 4. Live site shows actual deployment time
 * 
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * - writeFileSync throws an error if write fails (intentional fail-fast behavior)
 * - Console output provides deployment verification

/**
 * SCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT
 * 
 * This script is executed automatically by npm's predeploy hook:
 * 
 * package.json configuration:
 * {
 *   "scripts": {
 *     "predeploy": "npm run build && node update-timestamp.js",
 *     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * When running "npm run deploy":
 * 1. npm automatically runs predeploy script first
 * 2. predeploy builds React app and updates timestamp
 * 3. deploy script pushes to GitHub Pages
 * 4. Live site reflects actual deployment time
 * 
 * INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEM:
 * - Works with jQuery-based timestamp loading in main HTML
 * - Maintains compatibility with existing styling and layout
 * - Provides seamless user experience across portfolio projects
